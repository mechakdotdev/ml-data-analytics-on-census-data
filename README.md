An Independent Report on the 'Census Income' Dataset

My task as a data analyst is to take the “Census Income” dataset and gain insight on its characteristics and patterns using Python programming to cluster through and find any patterns in high- and low-income records. Another goal is to predict whether income exceeds $50,000 per annum (p/a) using classification through the same Python programming means. As the data set is quite large it will be required to be mined and therefore the CRISP-DM methodology will be useful here as it will help provide a structured approach when planning a data mining project (Simmons, 2014). The CRISP-DM will be applied to my problem in the business understanding to begin with to properly outline the data mining goal before proceeding to the data understanding and other stages of the methodology, which is addressed in further detail in the attached report.
